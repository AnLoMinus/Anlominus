                  <p><strong>Daemon</strong><br>A program which is often started at the time the system boots and runs continuously without intervention from any of the users on the system. The daemon program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate. The term daemon is a Unix term, though many other operating systems provide support for daemons, though they're sometimes called other names. Windows, for example, refers to daemons and System Agents and services.</p>
                  <p><strong>Data Aggregation</strong><br>Data Aggregation is the ability to get a more complete picture of the information by analyzing several different types of records at once.</p>

                  <p><strong>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</strong><br>A widely-used method of data encryption using a private (secret) key. There are 72,000,000,000,000,000 (72 quadrillion) or more possible encryption keys that can be used. For each given message, the key is chosen at random from among this enormous number of keys. Like other private key cryptographic methods, both the sender and the receiver must know and use the same private key.</p>
                  <p><strong>Data Mining</strong><br>Data Mining is a technique used to analyze existing information, usually with the intention of pursuing new avenues to pursue business.</p>

                  <p><strong>Data Warehousing</strong><br>Data Warehousing is the consolidation of several previously independent databases into one location.</p>
                  <p><strong>Datagram</strong><br>Request for Comment 1594 says, "a self-contained, independent entity of data carrying sufficient information to be routed from the source to the destination computer without reliance on earlier exchanges between this source and destination computer and the transporting network." The term has been generally replaced by the term packet. Datagrams or packets are the message units that the Internet Protocol deals with and that the Internet transports. A datagram or packet needs to be self-contained without reliance on earlier exchanges because there is no connection of fixed duration between the two communicating points as there is, for example, in most voice telephone conversations. (This kind of protocol is referred to as connectionless.)</p>
                  <p><strong>Day Zero</strong><br>The "Day Zero" or "Zero Day" is the day a new vulnerability is made known. In some cases, a "zero day" exploit is referred to an exploit for which no patch is available yet. ("day one"-&gt; day at which the patch is made available).</p>

                  <p><strong>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)</strong><br>In computer security, in general a demilitarized zone (DMZ) or perimeter network is a network area (a subnetwork) that sits between an organization's internal network and an external network, usually the Internet. DMZ's help to enable the layered security model in that they provide subnetwork segmentation based on security requirements or policy. DMZ's provide either a transit mechanism from a secure source to an insecure destination or from an insecure source to a more secure destination. In some cases, a screened subnet which is used for servers accessible from the outside is referred to as a DMZ.</p>
                  <p><strong>Denial of Service</strong><br>The prevention of authorized access to a system resource or the delaying of system operations and functions.</p>
                  <p><strong>Dictionary Attack</strong><br>An attack that tries all of the phrases or words in a dictionary, trying to crack a password or key. A dictionary attack uses a predefined list of words compared to a brute force attack that tries all possible combinations.</p>

                  <p><strong>Digest Authentication</strong><br>Digest Authentication allows a web client to compute MD5 hashes of the password to prove it has the password.</p>
                  <p><strong>Digital Certificate</strong><br>A digital certificate is an electronic "credit card" that establishes your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the Web. It is issued by a certification authority. It contains your name, a serial number, expiration dates, a copy of the certificate holder's public key (used for encrypting messages and digital signatures), and the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that a recipient can verify that the certificate is real.</p>
                  <p><strong>Digital Envelope</strong><br>A digital envelope is an encrypted message with the encrypted session key.</p>
                  <p><strong>Digital Signature</strong><br>A digital signature is a hash of a message that uniquely identifies the sender of the message and proves the message hasn't changed since transmission.</p>

                  <p><strong>Domain</strong><br>A sphere of knowledge, or a collection of facts about some program entities or a number of network points or addresses, identified by a name. On the Internet, a domain consists of a set of network addresses. In the Internet's domain name system, a domain is a name with which name server records are associated that describe sub-domains or host. In Windows NT and Windows 2000, a domain is a set of network resources (applications, printers, and so forth) for a group of users. The user need only to log in to the domain to gain access to the resources, which may be located on a number of different servers in the network.</p>
                  <p><strong>Domain Hijacking</strong><br>Domain hijacking is an attack by which an attacker takes over a domain by first blocking access to the domain's DNS server and then putting his own server up in its place.</p>
                  <p><strong>Domain Name</strong><br>A domain name locates an organization or other entity on the Internet. For example, the domain name "www.sans.org" locates an Internet address for "sans.org" at Internet point 199.0.0.2 and a particular host server named "www". The "org" part of the domain name reflects the purpose of the organization or entity (in this example, "organization") and is called the top-level domain name. The "sans" part of the domain name defines the organization or entity and together with the top-level is called the second-level domain name.</p>
                  <p><strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong><br>The domain name system (DNS) is the way that Internet domain names are located and translated into Internet Protocol addresses. A domain name is a meaningful and easy-to-remember "handle" for an Internet address.</p>

                  <p><strong>Due Diligence</strong><br>Due diligence is the requirement that organizations must develop and deploy a protection plan to prevent fraud, abuse, and additional deploy a means to detect them if they occur.</p>
                  <p><strong>DumpSec</strong><br>DumpSec is a security tool that dumps a variety of information about a system's users, file system, registry, permissions, password policy, and services.</p>
                  <p><strong>Dumpster Diving</strong><br>Dumpster Diving is obtaining passwords and corporate directories by searching through discarded media.</p>
                  <p><strong>Dynamic Link Library</strong><br>A collection of small programs, any of which can be called when needed by a larger program that is running in the computer. The small program that lets the larger program communicate with a specific device such as a printer or scanner is often packaged as a DLL program (usually referred to as a DLL file).</p>
                  <p><strong>Dynamic Routing Protocol</strong><br>Allows network devices to learn routes. Ex. RIP, EIGRP Dynamic routing occurs when routers talk to adjacent routers, informing each other of what networks each router is currently connected to. The routers must communicate using a routing protocol, of which there are many to choose from. The process on the router that is running the routing protocol, communicating with its neighbor routers, is usually called a routing daemon. The routing daemon updates the kernel's routing table with information it receives from neighbor routers.</p>

                  <p><strong>Filtering Router</strong><br>An inter-network router that selectively prevents the passage of data packets according to a security policy. A filtering router may be used as a firewall or part of a firewall. A router usually receives a packet from a network and decides where to forward it on a second network. A filtering router does the same, but first decides whether the packet should be forwarded at all, according to some security policy. The policy is implemented by rules (packet filters) loaded into the router.</p>

                  <p><strong>Network-Based IDS</strong><br>A network-based IDS system monitors the traffic on its network segment as a data source. This is generally accomplished by placing the network interface card in promiscuous mode to capture all network traffic that crosses its network segment. Network traffic on other segments, and traffic on other means of communication (like phone lines) can't be monitored. Network-based IDS involves looking at the packets on the network as they pass by some sensor. The sensor can only see the packets that happen to be carried on the network segment it's attached to. Packets are considered to be of interest if they match a signature.Network-based intrusion detection passively monitors network activity for indications of attacks. Network monitoring offers several advantages over traditional host-based intrusion detection systems. Because many intrusions occur over networks at some point, and because networks are increasingly becoming the targets of attack, these techniques are an excellent method of detecting many attacks which may be missed by host-based intrusion detection mechanisms.</p>

                  <p><strong>OSI</strong><br>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a standard description or "reference model" for how messages should be transmitted between any two points in a telecommunication network. Its purpose is to guide product implementers so that their products will consistently work with other products. The reference model defines seven layers of functions that take place at each end of a communication. Although OSI is not always strictly adhered to in terms of keeping related functions together in a well-defined layer, many if not most products involved in telecommunication make an attempt to describe themselves in relation to the OSI model. It is also valuable as a single reference view of communication that furnishes everyone a common ground for education and discussion.</p>
                  <p><strong>OSI layers</strong><br>The main idea in OSI is that the process of communication between two end points in a telecommunication network can be divided into layers, with each layer adding its own set of special, related functions. Each communicating user or program is at a computer equipped with these seven layers of function. So, in a given message between users, there will be a flow of data through each layer at one end down through the layers in that computer and, at the other end, when the message arrives, another flow of data up through the layers in the receiving computer and ultimately to the end user or program. The actual programming and hardware that furnishes these seven layers of function is usually a combination of the computer operating system, applications (such as your Web browser), TCP/IP or alternative transport and network protocols, and the software and hardware that enable you to put a signal on one of the lines attached to your computer. OSI divides telecommunication into seven layers. The layers are in two groups. The upper four layers are used whenever a message passes from or to a user. The lower three layers (up to the network layer) are used when any message passes through the host computer or router. Messages intended for this computer pass to the upper layers. Messages destined for some other host are not passed up to the upper layers but are forwarded to another host. The seven layers are: Layer 7: The application layer...This is the layer at which communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data syntax are identified. (This layer is not the application itself, although some applications may perform application layer functions.) Layer 6: The presentation layer...This is a layer, usually part of an operating system, that converts incoming and outgoing data from one presentation format to another (for example, from a text stream into a popup window with the newly arrived text). Sometimes called the syntax layer. Layer 5: The session layer...This layer sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogs between the applications at each end. It deals with session and connection coordination. Layer 4: The transport layer...This layer manages the end-to-end control (for example, determining whether all packets have arrived) and error-checking. It ensures complete data transfer. Layer 3: The network layer...This layer handles the routing of the data (sending it in the right direction to the right destination on outgoing transmissions and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level). The network layer does routing and forwarding. Layer 2: The data-link layer...This layer provides synchronization for the physical level and does bit-stuffing for strings of 1's in excess of 5. It furnishes transmission protocol knowledge and management. Layer 1: The physical layer...This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier.</p>

                  <p><strong>Threat</strong><br>A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm.</p>
                  <p><strong>Threat Assessment</strong><br>A threat assessment is the identification of types of threats that an organization might be exposed to.</p>
                  <p><strong>Threat Model</strong><br>A threat model is used to describe a given threat and the harm it could to do a system if it has a vulnerability.</p>
                  <p><strong>Threat Vector</strong><br>The method a threat uses to get to the target.</p>
                  <p><strong>Time to Live</strong><br>A value in an Internet Protocol packet that tells a network router whether or not the packet has been in the network too long and should be discarded.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tiny Fragment Attack</strong><br>With many IP implementations it is possible to impose an unusually small fragment size on outgoing packets. If the fragment size is made small enough to force some of a TCP packet's TCP header fields into the second fragment, filter rules that specify patterns for those fields will not match. If the filtering implementation does not enforce a minimum fragment size, a disallowed packet might be passed because it didn't hit a match in the filter. STD 5, RFC 791 states: Every Internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets without further fragmentation. This is because an Internet header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8 octets.</p>
                  <p><strong>Token Ring</strong><br>A token ring network is a local area network in which all computers are connected in a ring or star topology and a binary digit or token-passing scheme is used in order to prevent the collision of data between two computers that want to send messages at the same time.</p>
                  <p><strong>Token-Based Access Control</strong><br>Token based access control associates a list of objects and their privileges with each user. (The opposite of list based.)</p>
                  <p><strong>Token-Based Devices</strong><br>A token-based device is triggered by the time of day, so every minute the password changes, requiring the user to have the token with them when they log in.</p>
                  <p><strong>Topology</strong><br>The geometric arrangement of a computer system. Common topologies include a bus, star, and ring. The specific physical, i.e., real, or logical, i.e., virtual, arrangement of the elements of a network. Note 1: Two networks have the same topology if the connection configuration is the same, although the networks may differ in physical interconnections, distances between nodes, transmission rates, and/or signal types. Note 2: The common types of network topology are illustrated</p>
                  <p><strong>Traceroute (tracert.exe)</strong><br>Traceroute is a tool the maps the route a packet takes from the local machine to a remote destination.</p>
                  <p><strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</strong><br>A set of rules (protocol) used along with the Internet Protocol to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. While IP takes care of handling the actual delivery of the data, TCP takes care of keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.</p>
                  <p><strong>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</strong><br>A protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and their users on the Internet.

                  <p><strong>Triple-Wrapped</strong><br>S/MIME usage: data that has been signed with a digital signature, and then encrypted, and then signed again.</p>
                  <p><strong>Trojan Horse</strong><br>A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes the program.</p>
                  <p><strong>Trunking</strong><br>Trunking is connecting switched together so that they can share VLAN information between them.</p>
                  <p><strong>Trust</strong><br>Trust determine which permissions and what actions other systems or users can perform on remote machines.</p>
                  <p><strong>Trusted Ports</strong><br>Trusted ports are ports below number 1024 usually allowed to be opened by the root user.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tunnel</strong><br>A communication channel created in a computer network by encapsulating a communication protocol's data packets in (on top of) a second protocol that normally would be carried above, or at the same layer as, the first one. Most often, a tunnel is a logical point-to-point link - i.e., an OSI layer 2 connection - created by encapsulating the layer 2 protocol in a transport protocol (such as TCP), in a network or inter-network layer protocol (such as IP), or in another link layer protocol. Tunneling can move data between computers that use a protocol not supported by the network connecting them.</p>
                  <p><strong>UDP Scan</strong><br>UDP scans perform scans to determine which UDP ports are open.</p>
                  <p><strong>Unicast</strong><br>Broadcasting from host to host.</p>
                  <p><strong>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</strong><br>The generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the World Wide Web.</p>
                  <p><strong>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</strong><br>The global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. The first part of the address indicates what protocol to use, and the second part specifies the IP address or the domain name where the resource is located. For example, <a href="http://www.pcwebopedia.com/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link">http://www.pcwebopedia.com/ind...</a> .</p>
                  <p><strong>Unix</strong><br>A popular multi-user, multitasking operating system developed at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Created by just a handful of programmers, Unix was designed to be a small, flexible system used exclusively by programmers.</p>
                  <p><strong>Unprotected Share</strong><br>In Windows terminology, a "share" is a mechanism that allows a user to connect to file systems and printers on other systems. An "unprotected share" is one that allows anyone to connect to it.</p>
                  <p><strong>User</strong><br>A person, organization entity, or automated process that accesses a system, whether authorized to do so or not.</p>
                  <p><strong>User Contingency Plan</strong><br>User contingency plan is the alternative methods of continuing business operations if IT systems are unavailable.</p>
                  <p><strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</strong><br>A communications protocol that, like TCP, runs on top of IP networks. Unlike TCP/IP, UDP/IP provides very few error recovery services, offering instead a direct way to send and receive datagrams over an IP network. It's used primarily for broadcasting messages over a network. UDP uses the Internet Protocol to get a datagram from one computer to another but does not divide a message into packets (datagrams) and reassemble it at the other end. Specifically, UDP doesn't provide sequencing of the packets that the data arrives in.</p>

                  <p><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong><br>A restricted-use, logical (i.e., artificial or simulated) computer network that is constructed from the system resources of a relatively public, physical (i.e., real) network (such as the Internet), often by using encryption (located at hosts or gateways), and often by tunneling links of the virtual network across the real network. For example, if a corporation has LANs at several different sites, each connected to the Internet by a firewall, the corporation could create a VPN by (a) using encrypted tunnels to connect from firewall to firewall across the Internet and (b) not allowing any other traffic through the firewalls. A VPN is generally less expensive to build and operate than a dedicated real network, because the virtual network shares the cost of system resources with other users of the real network.</p>
                  <p><strong>Virus</strong><br>A hidden, self-replicating section of computer software, usually malicious logic, that propagates by infecting - i.e., inserting a copy of itself into and becoming part of - another program.

                  <p><strong>Windowing</strong><br>A windowing system is a system for sharing a computer's graphical display presentation resources among multiple applications at the same time. In a computer that has a graphical user interface (GUI), you may want to use a number of applications at the same time (this is called task). Using a separate window for each application, you can interact with each application and go from one application to another without having to reinitiate it. Having different information or activities in multiple windows may also make it easier for you to do your work. A windowing system uses a window manager to keep track of where each window is located on the display screen and its size and status. A windowing system doesn't just manage the windows but also other forms of graphical user interface entities.</p>
                  <p><strong>Windump</strong><br>Windump is a freeware tool for Windows that is a protocol analyzer that can monitor network traffic on a wire.</p>

                  <p><strong>Zero Day</strong><br>The "Day Zero" or "Zero Day" is the day a new vulnerability is made known. In some cases, a "zero day" exploit is referred to an exploit for which no patch is available yet. ("day one" - day at which the patch is made available).</p>
                  <p><strong>Zero-day attack</strong><br>A zero-day (or zero-hour or day zero) attack or threat is a computer threat that tries to exploit computer application vulnerabilities that are unknown to others or undisclosed to the software developer. Zero-day exploits (actual code that can use a security hole to carry out an attack) are used or shared by attackers before the software developer knows about the vulnerability.</p>
                  <p><strong>Zombies</strong><br>A zombie computer (often shortened as zombie) is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, a computer virus, or a trojan horse. Generally, a compromised machine is only one of many in a botnet, and will be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction. Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to zombies.</p>
