#Cloud
- A technology that allows us to access our files and/or services through the internet from anywhere in the world. 
- Technically speaking, it’s a collection of computers with large storage capabilities that remotely serve requests.

#Software
- A set of programs that tell a computer to perform a task. 
- These instructions are compiled into a package that users can install and use. 
- For example, Microsoft Office is an application software.

#Domain
- A group of computers, printers and devices that are interconnected and governed as a whole. 
- For example, your computer is usually part of a domain at your workplace.

#Virtual Private Network #VPN
- A tool that allows the user to remain anonymous while using the internet by masking the location and encrypting traffic.

#IP Address
- An internet version of a home address for your computer, which is identified when it communicates over a network; 
  - For example, connecting to the internet (a network of networks).

#PenetrationTesting

#Exploit
- A malicious application or script that can be used to take advantage of a computer’s vulnerability.

#Breach
- The moment a hacker successfully exploits a vulnerability in a computer or device, and gains access to its files and network.

#Firewall
- A defensive technology designed to keep the bad guys out. Firewalls can be hardware or software-based.

#Malware “the bad guy”
- An umbrella term that describes all forms of malicious software designed to wreak havoc on a computer. 
- Common forms include: viruses, trojans, worms and ransomware.

#SpyWare
- A type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge. 
- The capabilities include activity monitoring, collecting keystrokes, data harvesting (account information, logins, financial data), and more.

#Virus
- A type of malware aimed to corrupt, erase or modify information on a computer before spreading to others. 
- However, in more recent years, viruses like Stuxnet have caused physical damage.

#Ransomware
- A form of malware that deliberately prevents you from accessing files on your computer – holding your data hostage. 
- It will typically encrypt files and request that a ransom be paid in order to have them decrypted or recovered. 
  - For example, WannaCry Ransomware. 
- For more information on Ransomware, check out our free Ransomware Guide.

#Trojan
- A piece of malware that often allows a hacker to gain remote access to a computer through a “back door”.

#SpyWorm
- A piece of malware that can replicate itself in order to spread the infection to other connected computers.

#Bot/Botnet
- A type of software application or script that performs tasks on command, allowing an attacker to take complete control remotely of an affected computer. 
- A collection of these infected computers is known as a “botnet” and is controlled by the hacker or “bot-herder”.

#Phishing or Spear Phishing
- A technique used by hackers to obtain sensitive information. 
- For example, using hand-crafted email messages designed to trick people into divulging personal or confidential data such as passwords and bank account information.

#Rootkit
- Another kind of malware that allows cybercriminals to remotely control your computer. 
- Rootkits are especially damaging because they are hard to detect, making it likely that this type of malware could live on your computer for a long time.

#DDoS
- An acronym that stands for distributed denial of service – a form of cyber attack. 
- This attack aims to make a service such as a website unusable by “flooding” it with malicious traffic or data from multiple sources (often botnets).

#Encryption
- The process of encoding data to prevent theft by ensuring the data can only be accessed with a key.

#BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
- Refers to a company security policy that allows for employees’ personal devices to be used in business. 
- A BYOD policy sets limitations and restrictions on whether or not a personal phone or laptop can be connected over the corporate network.

#Pen-testing
- Short for “penetration testing,” this practice is a means of evaluating security using hacker tools and techniques with the aim of discovering vulnerabilities and evaluating security flaws.

#Social Engineering
- A technique used to manipulate and deceive people to gain sensitive and private information. 
- Scams based on social engineering are built around how people think and act. 
- So, once a hacker understands what motivates a person’s actions, they can usually retrieve exactly what they’re looking for – like financial data and passwords.

#Clickjacking
- A hacking attack that tricks victims into clicking on an unintended link or button, usually disguised as a harmless element.

#Deepfake
- An audio or video clip that has been edited and manipulated to seem real or believable. 
- The most dangerous consequence of the popularity of deepfakes is that they can easily convince people into believing a certain story or theory that may result in user-behavior with a bigger impact as in political or financial.

#White / #Black / and more Hats ..
 - When speaking in cyber security terms, the differences in hacker “hats” refers to the intention of the hacker. For example:

#White hat: Breaches the network to gain sensitive information with the owner’s consent – making it completely legal. 
  - This method is usually employed to test infrastructure vulnerabilities.

#Black hat: Hackers that break into the network to steal information that will be used to harm the owner or the users without consent. 
  - It’s entirely illegal. We’ve only covered the tip of the iceberg as far as cyber security terms, but this will get you started. 
  - Take the steps now to ensure that you and your business are protected – knowledge is power!
