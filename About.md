'I'm not a minus'

It occurred to me while searching for a brand name with which I could advertise in "Anonymity" ...

In this chapter it is taken from the word anonymous.

And because I learned a little information security, and I swam a little about it,

I decided to connect it somehow with this name (Anonymous) for some reason ...

And because of all the debts and troubles I have accumulated during my life ....

So I would think a lot about how to raise the motivation to start living "like new" ...

And I always had a feeling that no matter what I touched, I would get the most out of it.

Anluminos came out!

I understand that anyone can use the nickname only if they want to.

Because today, anyone who wants to happens to himself "Anonymous" lol ...

So hope I explained clearly enough and successfully to everyone down the road!
