## The Origin Story of AnLoMinus

### The Name
AnLoMinus is a unique brand name that was inspired by the word "anonymous." The creator of the brand, who had some knowledge in information security, wanted to connect the name to the concept of anonymity. After thinking about it for a while, the creator came up with the name Anluminos, which incorporates the word "anonymous" but also has a unique twist.

### The Motivation
The creator of AnLoMinus was also motivated by personal struggles, including debts and troubles that had accumulated over time. The creator wanted to find a way to start living "like new" and to get the most out of life.

### The Significance
The name AnLoMinus has personal significance for the creator, as it represents a new beginning and a fresh start. It also has broader significance, as it helps to differentiate the brand from other uses of the word "anonymous," which can be associated with the controversial online activist group Anonymous.

Overall, the origin story of AnLoMinus is a testament to the power of creativity and perseverance in the face of personal challenges. We wish the creator of AnLoMinus all the best in their new venture.

'I'm not a minus'

It occurred to me while searching for a brand name with which I could advertise in "Anonymity" ...

In this chapter it is taken from the word anonymous.

And because I learned a little information security, and I swam a little about it,

I decided to connect it somehow with this name (Anonymous) for some reason ...

And because of all the debts and troubles I have accumulated during my life ....

So I would think a lot about how to raise the motivation to start living "like new" ...

And I always had a feeling that no matter what I touched, I would get the most out of it.

Anluminos came out!

I understand that anyone can use the nickname only if they want to.

Because today, anyone who wants to happens to himself "Anonymous" lol ...

So hope I explained clearly enough and successfully to everyone down the road!
